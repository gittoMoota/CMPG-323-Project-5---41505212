The NWU Tech Trends Benefit Realisation Power BI report is designed to comprehensively analyze client and project data, focusing on metrics that drive business decision-making. This report empowers stakeholders by giving them access to high-level summaries, project details, and client performance insights. Through AI-enhanced analytics and data visualizations, the report offers a dynamic, interactive experience that enables users to explore key trends, monitor savings, and assess project outcomes with greater accuracy.

The report consists of three main pages: High-Level Metrics, Project Monitoring, and Client Monitoring. Each page serves a unique purpose, from giving stakeholders an overall view of the most critical data points to offering detailed insights into specific projects and clients. By leveraging Power BIâ€™s powerful visual and analytical tools, the report turns raw data into actionable intelligence, helping the organization to achieve its objectives more efficiently.

## **Data Connections and Configuration** ##

A live connection is established to securely integrate the necessary data sources, ensuring that the information within the report is always up-to-date. The data connection is carefully configured to follow best practices in data security, such as encryption and authentication, to protect sensitive information. Additionally, all fields from the data sources are appropriately mapped to their respective data types, such as numeric, text, and date fields, allowing the creation of accurate and meaningful visualizations.

In the data transformation process, the datasets undergo cleaning to remove duplicates and ensure consistency. A calculated column is introduced to enhance the dataset, adding a new metric for more advanced analytics. For example, a calculated column for Net Savings (calculated as the difference between Cost Savings and Time Savings) gives deeper insight into the financial outcomes of various projects. Furthermore, key measures such as Total Savings Over Time are added to facilitate more informative and insightful visualizations.

## **Filters** ##

Several filters are implemented to make the report more interactive and customizable, enabling users to refine the data based on different criteria. Filters are available for Project Name, Client Name, and Date Range, allowing stakeholders to focus on specific data points that matter most to them. These filters work across all pages and visuals, providing a consistent experience throughout the report.

## **AI-Enhanced Analytics** ##

To further enhance the analytical capabilities of the report, the following AI features are integrated. 

Key Influencers: This feature is included on the High-Level Metrics page and helps users understand which factors drive Total Savings. For example, it analyzes variables such as Client Size, Region, and Project Technology to identify what influences savings the most.

  Decomposition Tree: Found on the Project Monitoring page, this feature allows users to drill down into the sum of total Savings, explained by the Project Technology and Project name. It provides a clear, hierarchical breakdown of the data, enabling more granular analysis.
  
Q&A: Added to the Client Monitoring page, this AI feature identifies allows the user to analyze the data by asking questions regarding the loaded data.
